#Question 7

# Lists are mutable
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]

# Modifying the list
my_list[0] = 10
print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 2, 3]



# Strings are immutable
my_string = "Hello"
print(my_string)  # Output: Hello

# Trying to modify the string (Error: strings are immutable)
my_string[0] = "h"  # TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
